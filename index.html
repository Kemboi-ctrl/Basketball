        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p class="Left">Over the last few decades, there has been debates on whether we should pay college athletes or not. College athletes have a lot on their plate. They are a full-time college student and play for their specific sport. Balancing school alone is tough but then adding sports to the mix causes a lot of stress to and young adult. Colleges also bring in a lot of money from these college athletes and yet, they don’t receive a dime. According to Steve Cameron, in his article “The NCAA brings in $1 billion a year — here's why it refuses to pay its college athletes”, he states that “In the 2016-2017 school year, NCAA revenue reached $1 billion.” (Cameron). There is much money these athletes bring in and we should find a way to respectively give them their share. Currently, the governor of California, Gavin Newsom, signed the 'Fair Pay to Play Act', where the players are welcome to make money off of their name and image starting in 2023. The NCAA is refusing to obey this new law and wants to put an end to it. They had a plan to make things more modernized for these student athletes and the California could potentially ruin it. </p>

        <h2>Belifs</h2>
        <p class="Left">Student athletes should be paid a percentage of what they make the school. I think it’ll be unfair if some athletes in the same sport, got paid more than others. So, to prevent that, I believe ever athlete could get a base salary. Depending on the sport they play, these athletes should get a percentage on what the NCAA gets so they could provide for themselves in college. This solution only involves division one student athletes because they are the top college athletes and make the most money for the NCAA. For example, if a school brought in $50,000 off of revenue from their basketball team, each player should get 3% of that. Each sport won’t bring in the same amount of revenue so the percentage will vary, but I believe this is a good start in paying college athletes.</p>

        <h2>Support</h2>
        <p>Athletes from different sports have voiced their opinions on the NCAA and support the movement to paying college athletes. Katelyn Ohashi, a former gymnast for UCLA, fell victim to the NCAA. UCLA posted a video on YouTube of the gymnast getting perfect 10s for her performance which earned over millions of views. Even though she pulled that many views, she was a student athlete which meant that she couldn’t profit off of it. In the video, “Everyone Made Money Off My N.C.A.A. Career, Except Me.” Published by the New York Times. Ohashi said, “Along with this came a lot of attention and opportunities, but I couldn’t capitalize on them. I was handcuffed by the NCAA rules that prevented me from deriving any benefit from mu own name and likeness, regardless of the fact that after my final meet, I had no pro league to join.” (Ohashi). This is a prime example on how the NCAA use college athletes to make them money and make sure they get the most of it while she doesn’t see a dime. 
            Another advocate to the movement is Ramogi Huma. Ramogi is the founder of College Athletes Players Association. He played football for UCLA and has been the leader of the movement for over 15 years. Ramogi created a group called The National College Players Association (NCPA), to advocate for college athletes’ rights. Over 17,000 division one athletes has joined the group. Ramogi is also a co-author for the famous article “The $6 Billion Heist: Robbing College Athletes Under the Guise of Amateurism.” In the article, he tells us examples on how the NCAA have been ripping these kids off. “FBS football and men’s basketball players would receive full athletic scholarships plus an additional $6 billion between 2011-15 if not for the NCAA’s prohibition of a fair market” (Huma). The NCAA taking out the fair market has cost these star athletes because they aren’t allowed to profit of their name. “University of Texas football players will be denied approximately $2.2 million, incur scholarship shortfalls of over $14,000, and live below the federal poverty line by $784 per year between 2011-15” (Huma). People say scholarships are enough for these college athletes but, some don’t get the full amount of the scholarships and find themselves in debt after college.

        <h2>Barriers</h2>
        <p>Some barriers this solution has is some people believe it will encourage more cheating behind the scenes. According to Mark Emmert, In the article “Paying College Athletes Is a Terrible Idea”, he says colleges will bride students to attend their school even more than before and help them cheat in school. It will just make the situation worse (Emmert). Bribing players to play for their school happens a lot behind the scenes and the NCAA is trying to put a stop to this. They say if they start paying the athletes now, the situation will just worsen as now it’ll be legal for them to bribe them. Another barrier is that the NCAA believes college is just for school and school only. Sports is just something to do on the side. College athletes tend to graduate at a higher rate compared to their classmates because the coaches make sure they keep their grades high in order for them to play. So, if they start paying college athletes, they’ll slack off more often than not because they’re already earning money from sports (Emmert). College athletes slacking off because they’re already earing money could be true. But if you discipline the players and have them keep high grades in order to play and keep their scholarships, they will.</p>
